# Lab Code

You can follow along with the TA's tutorial by running the chunks below. 

```{r tryIt1, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to print the phrase "Hello World!" to the screen
print("Hello world!")
```

```{r tryIt2, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to compute what 5 times 7 is
5 * 7
```

```{r tryIt3, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to compute what 36 divided by 6 is, and assign it to x
x <- 36 / 6
```

```{r tryIt4, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to see the value of x that R has stored
x
```

```{r tryIt5, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to see what happens if you use X (capitalized) instead
X
```

```{r loadPenguins, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to load the penguins data set into the environment
penguins <- read.csv("penguins.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

```{r peekAtPenguins, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to peek at the penguins data set
head(penguins)
```

```{r structureData, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to examine the structure of the penguins data set
str(penguins)
```

```{r tableOneVariable, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to make a table of the species variable in the penguins data
table(penguins$species)
```

```{r tableTwoVariables, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to make a two-way frequency table of the variables species and island in the penguins data
table(penguins$species, penguins$island)
```

# R Code Cheat Sheet

## `<-`
- Assigns a value to a name
- `name <- value`

## `$`
- tells R that we are looking for a variable in a particular data frame
- `data_set_name$data_set_variable`

## `table(data_set_name$data_set_variable)`
- creates a table of the frequencies of one categorical variable

## `table(data_set_name$data_set_variable, data_set_name$data_set_variable)`
- creates a two way table of the frequencies of two categorical variables
