# Introduction

The data set `tuition_sample.csv` contains information about yearly cost of attendance, yearly cost of room and board, and yearly total cost of attendance (tuition + room and board) for 300 sampled public and private colleges and universities around the United States. 

In this question, you will produce numerical and graphical displays to help you answer questions about the differences in tuition between private and public colleges.

## Read in the Data

First, we need R to read in the data. Run the code in chunk below to import ("read in") the data in `tuition_sample.csv` and call it `tuition`. Refer back to the lab slides if you need a reminder about how to run a code chunk.

```{r readData, error = T}

tuition <- read.csv("tuition_sample.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

```

## Question 1

The first thing we should do with data is to look at a graphical display of the data. Let's create histograms for the in-state and out-of-state tuitions for the colleges in the sample. 

The following chunk has the code to create a histogram of in-state tuitions for the colleges in the sample. Notice that the code includes arguments to create a title (`main`), an x-axis label (`xlab`), a y-axis label (`ylab`). 

```{r hist_in_state_tuition, error = T}
hist(tuition$in_state_tuition, 
     main = "Histogram of In-state Tuitions", 
     xlab = "In-state Tuition ($)", 
     ylab = "Number of Colleges")
```

Use the following code chunk to create a histogram of out-of-state tuitions for the colleges in the sample. Be sure to add a title and labels for the axes by using the arguments `main`, `xlab`, and `ylab` for a plot title, x-axis label, and y-axis label. Note that you can copy the 4 lines of code from the previous code chunk, paste them after the comment in the following code chunk, and make your adjustments to the variable and the `main`, `xlab`, and `ylab` arguments as necessary.

```{r hist_out_of_state_tuition, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to write the code necessary to answer the question. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).
hist(tuition$out_of_state_tuition, 
     main = "Histogram of Out-of-state Tuitions", 
     xlab = "Out-of-state Tuition ($)", 
     ylab = "Number of Colleges")

```

## Question 2

In this question, we will find summary statistics for the in-state and out-of-state tuitions. 

The following chunk has the code to get the summary statistics and the standard deviation (because R is silly and doesn't give the standard deviation with `summary()`) for the in-state tuitions. 

```{r summary_in_state, error = T}
summary(tuition$in_state_tuition)
sd(tuition$in_state_tuition)
```

Use the following code chunk to get the summary statistics and the standard deviation for the out-of-state tuitions. Note that you can copy the 2 lines of code from the previous code chunk, paste them after the comment in the following code chunk, and make your adjustments to the variable names.

```{r summary_out_of_state, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to write the code necessary to answer the question. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).

summary(tuition$out_of_state_tuition)
sd(tuition$out_of_state_tuition)

```

Now answer these questions:
a. Look back at the histogram of the in-state tuitions. Report the value of the best measure of center (mean or median) for the distribution of in-state tuitions. Briefly explain why you chose this measure of center.

Since the histogram for the in-state tuitions is skewed, the appropriate measure of center for the cost of in-state tuition is the median of \$16,515.

b. Look back at the histogram of the out-of-state tuitions. Report the value of the best measure of center (mean or median) for the distribution of out-of-state tuitions. Briefly explain why you chose this measure of center.

Since the histogram for the in-state tuitions is skewed, the appropriate measure of center for the cost of out-of-state tuition is the median of \$23,338.

## Question 3

Let's compare the in-state tuitions for public institutions and private institutions by making side-by-side box plots of the quantitative variable in-state tuition by the categorical variable institution type.

Here is the code to create the side-by-side box plot:

```{r boxplots_in_state, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to write the code necessary to answer the question. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).

boxplot(tuition$in_state_tuition ~ tuition$type,
        main = "Boxplots of Yearly In-State Tuition by Institution Type",
        xlab = "Institution Type",
        ylab = "Tuition ($)",
        col = c("#003660", "#FEBC11"))

```

Now, create a side-by-side box plot of the quantitative variable out-of-state tuition by the categorical variable institution type. Note that you can copy the 5 lines of code from the previous code chunk, paste them after the comment in the following code chunk, and make your adjustments to the variable names.

```{r boxplots_out_of_state, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to write the code necessary to answer the question. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).

boxplot(tuition$out_of_state_tuition ~ tuition$type,
        main = "Boxplots of Yearly Out-of-State Tuition by Institution Type",
        xlab = "Institution Type",
        ylab = "Tuition ($)",
        col = c("#003660", "#FEBC11"))

```

## Question 4

Run the following code chunk so that you can see the summary statistics for in-state and out-of-state tuitions by type of institution.

```{r summary_by_school_type, error = TRUE}
#Remove the # at the beginning of each of the code lines so that this function runs on the data
tapply(tuition$in_state_tuition, tuition$type, summary)

tapply(tuition$out_of_state_tuition, tuition$type, summary)

```

Does it appear that in-state tuitions differ by institution type (private, public)? How about out-of-state tuitions? Be sure to address aspects of what you see in the side-by-side boxplots from Question 3 and to the output from the code chunk above to support your answers.

# Answer
Yes, it does appear that the institution type has an effect on both in-state and out-of-state tuitions. For in-state tuitions, private universities tend to be more expensive overall, with the median cost approximately \$20,000-\$25,000 more for private than  public schools. For out-of-state tuitions, private universities still tend to be more expensive overall, with the median cost approximately \$10,000-\$15,000 more for private schools than for public schools.
